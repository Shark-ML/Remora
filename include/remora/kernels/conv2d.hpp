///\brief Computes the convolution of a multi-channel image with a set of filters. 
///
/// Computes the result of applying k filters to an image where filters and image are allowed
/// to have multiple images (some would call this a 3d or even 4d convolution, but we refrain from this as 
/// for two dimensions filter dimensions and image dimension must agree. E.g. it does not behave like convoluting a volume)
/// The base for the convolution is the upper left corner and there is no boundary handling, i.e. only pixels within the image area
/// are computed.
///
/// The image are stored block-row-wise. i.e. an image of size nxm with k channels is stored as 
/// and (n*k)x m matrix where n consecutive rows for the row of an image.
/// Filters are stored similarly, only that in their case we have the format (n1*k*l) x m1 for a
/// set of l filters of size n1 x m1 with k channels each. the n1 rows form a channel, k*n1 rows form
/// a filter.
/// the output format is stored in the same way as image just with size (l* (m-m1+1))x(n-n1+1).
/// The caller must ensure that enough memory is stored.
