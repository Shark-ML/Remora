List of defects in the current implementation.

- slice for full indexing is a stub and inefficient.
- merge has no good optimizer for the case of consecutive merges. 
- scalar operations (E.g. multiplying vector with scalar) do not correctly compute the target type but take vector-type instead
- scalar operations on gpu still eprform a round-trip ->cpu
